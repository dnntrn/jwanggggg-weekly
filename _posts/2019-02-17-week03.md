## Creating Candela

Creating Candela was a great experience; excluding Beastify and Borderify, it was my first real Firefox extension 
I've worked on. Out of the three members on my team, I was the least experienced with JavaScript so my other two members
did a large part of the implementation, but that didn't mean I was unable to contribute. I proposed the initial concept of
using a screen filter to help students who were studying, and Jim and Thomas were both on board and we discussed ways we could
 implement the filter. We worked entirely remotely, and both Jim and Thomas were very easy to work with and did their parts.
 Design-wise, we decided on using an orange filter because it was much easier on the eyes than the unfiltered blue light,
 and we communicated mainly through Facebook Messenger and GitHub.
