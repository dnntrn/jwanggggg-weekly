## Evaluating 2048

I picked the popular open-source web game [2048](https://play2048.co). I picked 2048 because it is a game that I have a lot of nostalgic memories playing back in high school with my friends, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it is an open-source project! I am also interested in games in general, so 2048 was an easy choice for me to evaluate. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the scope of open-source contributions that 2048 allowed for - the project just barely under 30 contributors, and while the members were friendly, contributions were not encouraged for beginners, which is understandable because the core concept of the game is quite simple and does not leave much room for change.
