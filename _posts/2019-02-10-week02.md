# Week 2 Blog Post

This week, Team 10 worked on our browser extension Candela, which is a light filter for FireFox. I proposed the original idea of using the orange light filter, created the 48x48 and 32x32 icons for the extension, and helped write portions of the JavaScript script. Our team is nearly done with the extension - our JS script for changing the actual screen color is complete and we only need to add an additional time-dependent feature. Unfortunately, we are currently struggling with getting the button to change the screen. However, this remains the last obstacle so we will most likely have a presentable project by Monday.

I am still relatively unfamiliar with GitHub and Git, and this week I learned some of the crucial terminology - mainly "fork" and "merge", which create a personal copy of a target repository and merge changes back into a master branch respectively. I understand now how these are crucial for software engineering practices. I am also learning how to use Git through terminal currently.
